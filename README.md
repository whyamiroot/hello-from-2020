# Hello there

Hello, descendants from 3020, this is the 31st January of 2020 here and it's pretty shit - no Mars colonies, no dog-thoughts-to-speech interfaces, Steam is down every sale as though they don't expect it, I'm out of cigarettes, my pet bear is losing weight, neighbouring tribe is trying to take over our well. Hope you're good over there.
